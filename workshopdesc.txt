[h1]Spicetrauma - Enriched Ammo Deconstruction 1.0.1[/h1]
is a simple mod that allows all turret ammunition boxes and gun magazines (above a certain quality) to be deconstructed for part of the cost of their actual munitions.

[h2]What exactly does this mod do?[/h2]
A handful of special ammo boxes, such as Physicorium, return their respective special materials when deconstructed at high condition. Most other ammo boxes, however, don't. This is, as I interpret it, for a pretty good reason - any other material that deconstruction could return is part of a recipe with alternatives, potentially allowing for material conversion shenanigans. The same applies to all magazines without exception.

However, the fact that not all boxes (and mags, for that matter) return anything other than the packaging material still irks me, so I decided to take a stab at it. Though the idea primarily came about to make looting a teeny bit more rewarding, it's also helpful for ammo crafting in a general sense.

It also slightly reduces the condition thresholds for returning said ammo materials, allowing for a little more leeway when it comes to deconstructing.

This mod [i]only[/i] affects magazines and ammo boxes; individual projectiles, such as railgun shells and revolver rounds, are completely unchanged.

This is not a straightforward improvement! Creating recipes that are at least passably balanced and mitigate cheesing potential is hard and imperfect, and you might not agree with my choices.

[h2]Is this mod compatible with X?[/h2]
This is a relatively unintrusive mod that shouldn't break anything by itself. It can be added or removed during a campaign at any time without issue.
If a mod edits any of the above changed items, its changes will be overridden if this mod loads after (is above) it; likewise, this mod's changes will be overridden if it loads before (is below) the other mod. If you'd like a compatibility patch, ask for it!

[h2]Can you add cross-mod support for X?[/h2]
Potentially, though I've yet to dabble in pretty much any content mod, and am not familiar with what's out there either. If you have a mod that you want me to add support for, consider reaching out to ask.

[h2]How often does this mod update?[/h2]
As this is a very small mod, there's not much to do except keep on the lookout for bugs and cross-mod support opportunities. As such, it will only get updated when needed.
