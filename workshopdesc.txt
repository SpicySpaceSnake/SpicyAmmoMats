[h1]Spicetrauma - Enriched Ammo Deconstruction 1.0.1[/h1]
is a simple mod that allows all turret ammunition boxes and gun magazines (above a certain quality) to be deconstructed for part of the cost of their actual munitions.

[hr][/hr]
[h2]What exactly does this mod do?[/h2]
A handful of special ammo boxes, such as Physicorium, return their respective special materials when deconstructed at high condition. Most other ammo boxes, however, don't. This is, as I interpret it, for a pretty good reason - any other material that deconstruction could return is part of a recipe with alternatives, potentially allowing for material conversion shenanigans. The same applies to all magazines without exception.

However, the fact that not all boxes (and mags, for that matter) return anything other than the packaging material still irks me, so I decided to take a stab at it. Though the idea primarily came about to make looting a teeny bit more rewarding, it's also helpful for ammo crafting in a general sense.

It also slightly reduces the condition thresholds for returning said ammo materials, allowing for a little more leeway when it comes to deconstructing.

This mod [i]only[/i] affects magazines and ammo boxes; individual projectiles, such as railgun shells and revolver rounds, are completely unchanged.

This is not a straightforward improvement! Creating recipes that are at least passably balanced and mitigate cheesing potential is hard and imperfect, and you might not agree with my choices.

[h3]Recipe changes[/h3]
Explanations are spoiler-tagged to reduce visual clutter.
[b]SMG Magazine[/b]
Steel Bar x1, [u]Iron x1[/u]
[spoiler]Small amounts of the most common material in the recipe, as this ammo is relatively weak[/spoiler]
[b]Depleted Fuel SMG Magazine[/b]
Steel Bar x1, Depleted Fuel x1, [u]Phosphorus x1[/u]
[spoiler]Would've also given it iron, but I felt phosphor was more appropriate for the overall cost[/spoiler]
[b]HMG Magazine[/b]
Steel Bar x1, [u]Magnesium x1[/u], [u]Titanium-Aluminum Alloy x1[/u]
[spoiler]One of the rare instances where an ingredient doesn't have an alternative! Included nothing else so as to not make it too good[/spoiler]
[b]Assault Rifle Magazine[/b]
Steel Bar x1, [u]Magnesium x1[/u], [u]Steel Bar x1[/u], [u]Copper x1[/u]
[spoiler]Like the HMG mag, magnesium doesn't have alts. The others are the two most common mats, added for extra padding[/spoiler]

[b]Coilgun Ammunition Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, [u]Iron x2[/u]
[spoiler]Some recipes return ingredients of ingredients - and for that, iron was the perfect candidate, as it's very common and only makes up a third of the ammo's recipe[/spoiler]
[b]Piercing Coilgun Ammunition Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, [u]Steel Bar x1[/u]
[spoiler]Also makes up only a third of the recipe, and is the most common of the possible materials by a large margin[/spoiler]
[b]Coilgun Harpoon Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, [u]Organic Fiber x1[/u]
[spoiler]More common than steel; straightforward enough[/spoiler]

[b]Chaingun Ammunition Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, [u]Copper x2[/u]
[spoiler]Like the normal coilgun ammo, except that chaingun ammo is more expensive and deserves the next most common material[/spoiler]
[b]Shredder Chaingun Ammunition Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, [u]Steel Bar x2[/u]
[spoiler]Like the piercing coilgun ammo, is the most common of the possible materials[/spoiler]
[b]Physicorium Chaingun Ammunition Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, Physicorium Bar x1, [u]Steel Bar x1[/u]
[spoiler]Mostly for a little extra padding, as the less expensive coilgun equivalent normally returns the same amount which doesn't make much sense[/spoiler]

[b]Spreader Flak Shells Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, [u]Copper x1[/u], [u]Phosphorus x1[/u]
[spoiler]To avoid redundancy with the basic coilgun and chaingun ammos; phosphorus is also the more common of the two explosive powders[/spoiler]
[b]Focused Flak Shells Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, [u]Steel Bar x1[/u], [u]Phosphorus x1[/u]
[spoiler]Slightly less common materials from more expensive ammo[/spoiler]
[b]Explosive Flak Shells Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, [strike]C-4 Block x1[/strike] [u]Sodium x2[/u], [u]Plastic x1[/u]
[spoiler]I don't like removing things, but I felt this would make sense considering that the coilgun equivalent returns sodium instead of C-4 or UEX. Also gives you one of the plastic from the C-4[/spoiler]
[b]Physicorium Flak Shells Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, Physicorium Bar x1, [u]Magnesium x1[/u]
[spoiler]Like the chaingun equivalent, all that's needed is a little extra padding[/spoiler]

[h3]Return Threshold Changes[/h3]
Ammo boxes must be above these conditions when they're deconstructed, or they will only produce aluminum.
For most, this threshold is ≥90%, changed from either 95 (in every case where a munition mat was already given) or nothing at all, to create a parallel with the ≤10% refill threshold.
However, there are some exceptions:
[u]Coilgun Ammunition Box[/u]
∅ → ≥90% + ≥45%
[spoiler]Applies to the iron; this is a concept taken from Gravity Flak, the only vanilla ammo to have two munition mat thresholds[/spoiler]
[u]Coilgun Harpoon Box[/u]
∅ → ≥65%
[spoiler]For parity with other boxes; gives you a single free shot[/spoiler]
[u]Chaingun Ammunition Box[/u]
∅ → ≥90% + ≥45%
[spoiler]Applies to the copper[/spoiler]
[u]Shredder Chaingun Ammunition Box[/u]
∅ → ≥90% + ≥45%
[spoiler]Applies to the steel bars[/spoiler]
[u]Explosive Flak Shells Box[/u]
≥95% → ≥90% + ≥45%
[spoiler]Applies to the sodium[/spoiler]
[u]Gravity Flak Shells Box[/u]
≥95% + ≥50% → ≥90% + ≥45%
[spoiler]Applies to the Dementonite[/spoiler]

[h2]Is this mod compatible with X?[/h2]
This is a relatively unintrusive mod that shouldn't break anything by itself. It can be added or removed during a campaign at any time without issue.
If a mod edits any of the above changed items, its changes will be overridden if this mod loads after (is above) it; likewise, this mod's changes will be overridden if it loads before (is below) the other mod. If you'd like a compatibility patch, ask for it!

[h2]Can you add cross-mod support for X?[/h2]
Potentially, though I've yet to dabble in pretty much any content mod, and am not familiar with what's out there either. If you have a mod that you want me to add support for, consider reaching out to ask.

[hr][/hr]
[h2]How often does this mod update?[/h2]
As this is a very small mod, there's not much to do except keep on the lookout for bugs and cross-mod support opportunities. As such, it will only get updated when needed.
