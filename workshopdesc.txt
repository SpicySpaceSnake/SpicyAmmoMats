[h1]Spicetrauma:Enriched Ammo Deconstruction[/h1]
is a simple mod that allows all turret ammunition boxes and gun magazines (above a certain quality) to be deconstructed for part of the cost of their actual munitions.

[hr][/hr]
[h2]What exactly does this mod do?[/h2]
A handful of special ammo boxes, such as Physicorium, return their respective special materials when deconstructed at high condition. Most other ammo boxes, however, don't. This is, as I interpret it, for a pretty good reason - any other material that deconstruction could return is part of a recipe with alternatives, potentially allowing for material conversion shenanigans. The same applies to all magazines without exception.

However, the fact that not all boxes/mags return anything other than the packaging material still irks me, so I decided to take a stab at it. Though the idea primarily came about to make looting a teeny bit more rewarding, it's also helpful for ammo crafting in a general sense.

In the case of ammo boxes, it also reduces the condition thresholds for returning said ammo materials, allowing for a little more leeway when it comes to deconstructing.

This mod [i]only[/i] affects magazines and ammo boxes; individual projectiles, such as railgun shells and revolver rounds, are completely unchanged.

This is not a straightforward improvement! Creating recipes that are at least passably balanced and mitigate cheesing potential is hard and imperfect, and you might not agree with my choices.

[h3]Recipe changes[/h3]
[b]SMG Magazine[/b]
Steel Bar x1, [u]Iron x1[/u]
[*]Small amounts of the most common material in the recipe, as this ammo is relatively weak
[b]Depleted Fuel SMG Magazine[/b]
Steel Bar x1, Depleted Fuel x1, [u]Phosphorus x1[/u]
[*]Would've also given it iron, but I felt phosphor was more appropriate for the overall cost
[b]HMG Magazine[/b]
Steel Bar x1, [u]Magnesium x1[/u], [u]Titanium-Aluminum Alloy x1[/u]
[*]One of the rare instances where an ingredient doesn't have an alternative! Included nothing else so as to not make it too good
[b]Assault Rifle Magazine[/b]
Steel Bar x1, [u]Magnesium x1[/u], [u]Steel Bar x1[/u], [u]Copper x1[/u]
[*]Like the HMG mag, magnesium doesn't have alts. The others are the two most common mats, added for extra padding

[b]Coilgun Ammunition Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, [u]Iron x2[/u]
[*]Some recipes return ingredients of ingredients - and for that, iron was the perfect candidate, as it's very common and only makes up a third of the ammo's recipe
[b]Piercing Coilgun Ammunition Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, [u]Steel Bar x1[/u]
[*]Also makes up only a third of the recipe, and is the most common of the possible materials by a large margin
[b]Coilgun Harpoon Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, [u]Organic Fiber x1[/u]
[*]More common than steel; straightforward enough

[b]Chaingun Ammunition Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, [u]Copper x2[/u]
[*]Like the normal coilgun ammo, except that chaingun ammo is more expensive and deserves the next most common material
[b]Shredder Chaingun Ammunition Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, [u]Steel Bar x2[/u]
[*]Like the piercing coilgun ammo, is the most common of the possible materials
[b]Physicorium Chaingun Ammunition Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, Physicorium Bar x1, [u]Steel Bar x1[/u]
[*]Mostly for a little extra padding, as the less expensive coilgun equivalent normally returns the same amount which doesn't make much sense

[b]Spreader Flak Shells Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, [u]Copper x1[/u], [u]Phosphorus x1[/u]
[*]To avoid redundancy with the basic coilgun and chaingun ammos; phosphorus is also the more common of the two explosive powders
[b]Focused Flak Shells Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, [u]Steel Bar x1[/u], [u]Phosphorus x1[/u]
[*]Slightly less common materials from more expensive ammo
[b]Explosive Flak Shells Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, [strike]C-4 Block x1[/strike] [u]Sodium x2[/u], [u]Plastic x1[/u]
[*]I don't like removing things, but I felt this would make sense considering that the coilgun equivalent returns sodium instead of C-4 or UEX. Also gives you one of the plastic from the C-4
[b]Physicorium Flak Shells Box[/b]
Aluminum x1, Physicorium Bar x1, [u]Magnesium x1[/u]
[*]Like the chaingun equivalent, all that's needed is a little extra padding

[b]Unchanged[/b]
[list]
[*]Explosive Coilgun Ammunition Box
[*]Depleted Fuel Coilgun Ammunition Box
[*]Physicorium Ammunition Box
[*]Pulse Laser Fuel Box
[*]Pulse Tri-Laser Fuel Box
[*]Gravity Flak Shells Box
[/list]

[h3]Return Threshold Changes[/h3]
Ammo boxes must be above these conditions when they're deconstructed, or they will only produce aluminum.
Most are simply changed to ≥90%, to create a parallel with the ≤10% refill threshold.
[u]SMG Magazine[/u]
[*]∅ → ≥90% | ∅ → 2 shots
[u]Depleted Fuel SMG Magazine[/u]
[*]∅ → ≥90% | ∅ → 2 shots
[u]HMG Magazine[/u]
[*]∅ → ≥90% | ∅ → 10 shots
[u]Assault Rifle Magazine[/u]
[*]∅ → ≥90% | ∅ → 3 shots
[u]Coilgun Ammunition Box[/u]
[*]∅ → ≥90% | ∅ → 20 shots
[u]Piercing Coilgun Ammunition Box[/u]
[*]∅ → ≥90% | ∅ → 15 shots
[u]Explosive Coilgun Ammunition Box[/u]
[*]≥95% → ≥90% | 8 shots → 15 shots
[u]Depleted Fuel Coilgun Ammunition Box[/u]
[*]≥95% → ≥90% | 10 shots → 20 shots
[u]Physicorium Ammunition Box[/u]
[*]≥95% → ≥90% | 10 shots → 20 shots
[u]Coilgun Harpoon Box[/u]
[*]∅ → ≥65% | ∅ → 1 shot
[u]Chaingun Ammunition Box[/u]
[*]∅ → ≥90% | ∅ → 50 shots
[u]Shredder Chaingun Ammunition Box[/u]
[*]∅ → ≥90% | ∅ → 40 shots
[u]Physicorium Chaingun Ammunition Box[/u]
[*]≥95 → ≥90% | 25 shots → 50 shots
[u]Pulse Laser Fuel Box[/u]
[*]≥95 → ≥90% | 3 shots → 5 shots
[u]Pulse Tri-Laser Fuel Box[/u]
[*]≥95 → ≥90% | 2 shots → 3 shots
[u]Spreader Flak Shells Box[/u]
[*]∅ → ≥90% | ∅ → 4 shots
[u]Focused Flak Shells Box[/u]
[*]∅ → ≥90% | ∅ → 4 shots
[u]Explosive Flak Shells Box[/u]
[*]≥95% → ≥90% | 2 → 4 shots
[u]Physicorium Flak Shells Box[/u]
[*]≥95% → ≥90% | 2 → 4 shots
[u]Gravity Flak Shells Box[/u]
[*]≥95% + ≥50% → ≥90% + ≥45% | 1 + 10 → 2 + 11 shots

[h2]Is this mod compatible with X?[/h2]
This is a relatively unintrusive mod that shouldn't break anything by itself. It can be added or removed during a campaign at any time without issue.
If a mod edits any of the vanilla ammo box items, its changes will be overridden if this mod loads after it; likewise, this mod's changes will be overridden if it loads before the other mod. If you'd like a compatibility patch, be sure to ask for it!

[h2]Can you add cross-mod support for X?[/h2]
Potentially, though I've yet to dabble in pretty much any content mod, and am not familiar with what's out there either. If you're the owner of (or somehow affiliated with) a mod that you want me to add support for, consider reaching out to ask.

[hr][/hr]
[h2]How often does this mod update?[/h2]
As this is a very small mod, there's not much to do except keep on the lookout for bugs and cross-mod support opportunities. As such, it will only get updated when needed.
