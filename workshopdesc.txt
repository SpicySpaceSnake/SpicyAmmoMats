[h1]Spicetrauma - Immersive Ammunition 1.1.0[/h1]
is the spiritual successor to the original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3089776991]Immersive Ammunition Boxes[/url] - it extends its crafting quality changes to gun magazines, fixes up the ammo box sprites a bit further, and packs both mag and ammo box deconstruction functionality for even greater immersion.

[hr][/hr]
[h2]What exactly does this mod do?[/h2]
A handful of special turret ammo boxes (eg. Physicorium) return their respective special materials when deconstructed at high condition. Most other boxes and all magazines, however, don't, because many recipes have alternative mats and deconstructing into any given material could allow for conversion shenanigans. However, the fact still irks me, so I decided to take a stab at a balanced method.

All four gun magazines, and turret ammo boxes that didn't previously return materials, now return materials above 90% condition. Turret ammo boxes that already do return materials now return them above 90% condition instead of 95%, and may have altered mats.

As of 1.1.0, the mod also incorporates the changes from Immersive Ammo Boxes: both turret ammo boxes [i]and[/i] gun mags are now affected by crafting quality, and all ammo box sprites no longer have their right edge sheared off (along with recieving some other minor cleanups).

[h3]Change Specifics[/h3]
I've made a breakdown of the deconstrucion materials and thresholds in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/3410901374/677329263114902600]one of this mod's Discussions[/url], as well as a complete list of how quality affects the number of shots per mag/box using [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16f5hblI8hwDFCwQZWO0pRVdLvZQbS1pdVFyBT1Ec7og/edit?usp=sharing]a table on Google Sheets[/url].

[h2]Is this mod compatible with X?[/h2]
This is a relatively unintrusive mod that shouldn't break anything by itself. It can be added or removed during a campaign at any time without issue.
If a mod edits any of the above changed items, its changes will be overridden if this mod loads after (is above) it; likewise, this mod's changes will be overridden if it loads before (is below) the other mod. If you'd like a compatibility patch, ask for it!

Compatibility patches for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2764968387]Enhanced Armaments[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3028141718]Combat Overhaul Legacy[/url], and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2784626867]Vanilla Weapons Enhanced[/url] are in the works.

[h3][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3089776991]Immersive Ammunition Boxes[/url][/h3]
While the original Immersive Ammo Boxes and this mod should be treated as mutually exclusive due to overlapping roles, they shouldn't break each other. Standard load order advice applies.

[h2]Can you add cross-mod support for X?[/h2]
Potentially, though I've yet to dabble in pretty much any content mod, and am not familiar with what's out there either. If you have a mod that you want me to add support for, consider reaching out to ask.

[hr][/hr]
[h2]How often does this mod update?[/h2]
The core mod will only recieve updates when needed, as there's not much more to do. However, I'm on the active lookout for bugs and cross-mod compat/support opportunities.

[b]CURRENT FOCUS:[/b] cross-mod compatibility
[b]CURRENT STATUS:[/b] core being passively maintained; patches being actively developed
